# Core insights:

  ## 1. Scatter Plot - Correlate the offices longitude and latitude. ‚§µÔ∏è
  
  ### Analyzed office location data using Python, focusing on geographical distribution, checked for the presence of 'longitude' and 'latitude'  and visualized the data with a scatter plot.

  ## 2. Line Plot - trends observed in the number of funds created over the years. ‚§µÔ∏è
  
  ### Analysis how the number of funds created changes over time and it groups funds by date to count the number created using a line plot.

  ## 3. Bar Chart - Identifying states in the USA have the highest number of office locations.  ‚§µÔ∏è
  
  ### Examine the states with the most office locations in the USA. The Python script first ensures that the dataset contains both 'state_code' and 'country_code' columns. Then, it filters the data to focus on the USA and counts the number of offices in each state. The top 20 states with the highest office counts are displayed in a bar chart using seaborn. This visualization provides a clear comparison, showing California (CA) leading, followed by New York (NY) and Massachusetts (MA), among others. This insight helps in understanding regional office distribution trends across the country.

  ## 4. Filled Map - finding states in the USA have the highest number of office locations, and how does the distribution vary. ‚§µÔ∏è
  
### The visualization highlights that states like California (CA), New York (NY), and Massachusetts (MA) have the highest concentrations of offices. This data can be useful for identifying business hubs, understanding regional economic activity, or making strategic expansion decisions.Analysis centers on examining office distribution across different states in the USA.

  ## 5. Column Chart - countries have the highest Managements. ‚§µÔ∏è

  ### Focusing on identifying the distribution of office locations across different countries. The Python script reads data from offices.csv and verifies the presence of the 'country_code' column. It then counts the number of offices per country and visualizes the distribution using a bar chart with plotly.express. The resulting graph highlights the countries with the most office locations, with the USA leading significantly.
